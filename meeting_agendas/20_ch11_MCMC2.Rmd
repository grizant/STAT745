# i. Week 11 Focus

- Students Practice on Ch. 10 content.
- Students receive and act on Ch. 8, 9 feedback.
- Read MCMC Ch. 11.
- Discuss MCMC Ch. 11.

## Any questions on Ch.10 HW?

- 10.1 - 10.3
- 10.6

## Today's plan

i. Open with questions on Ch. 11 Problem Set to prime learning.
ii. Discuss Ch. 11 MCMC part 2
iii. Summarize, conclude, revisit Ch. 11 Problem prompt discussion / hints time remaining

*Please contribute questions and comments*

## State-of-the-art MCMC

- Particle simulators including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). 
- HMC has great diagnostics for monitoring convergence based on physical properties.

# Closing / Ch. 11 Problem set

- Revisit HW.
- Questions?
- Students please summarize/ask questions about what we discussed today.
