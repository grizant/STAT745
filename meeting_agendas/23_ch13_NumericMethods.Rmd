# i. Week 13 Focus

- Students Practice on Ch.12 content.
- Students receive and act on Ch. 11 feedback.
- Read Numerical Methods in R Ch. 13
- Read Optimization Ch. 14
- Discuss Ch. 13, 14

## Any questions on Ch.12 HW?

- 12.1 Histogram estimation
- 12.4 Frequency polygon density
- 12.6 ASH density for old faithful
- 12.8 Kernel density for `buffalo` snowfall data.
- 12.13 Generalize 2D ASH (BONUS NOW)

## Today's plan

i. Open with questions on Ch.13 Problem Set to prime learning.
ii. Discuss Ch.13 Numerical Methods in R
iii. Summarize, conclude, revisit Ch. 13 Problem prompt discussion / hints time remaining

*Please contribute questions and comments*

# Ch. 13 Numercial Methods in R

- 13.1 Introduction
- 13.2 Root-finding in One Dimension
- 13.3 Numerical Integration
- 13.4 Maximum Likelihood Problems
- 13.5 Application: Evaluating an Expected Value

# I. Ch.13 HW Preview

## Ch.13 HW Preview/Hints

- 13.3 Efficient implementation a high dimension, computationally intense procedure.
- 13.4 Computing critical values for a nonstandard statistical procedure. Hint: work with the difference and find 1D root. Note the function is well defined for $|a|=k$.
- 13.5 Computing critical values for a nonstandard statistical procedure II. Hint: connect to your answer from 13.4 by noticing the distribution functions appearing in the equation. How can you represent this in terms of CDFs? Then the calculation will be trivial.

# 13.1 Introduction

## 13.1 Introduction

- Overview
- Computer representation of real numbers
- R Note 13.2 is important.
- Example 13.1 Identical and nearly equal
- Example 13.2 Ratio of two large numbers
- Evaluating Functions
- Example 13.3 Taylor expansion
- Example 13.4 Derviative of zeta function
- Example 13.5 Derviative of zeta function (con'd)

# 13.2 Root-finding in One Dimension

## 13.2 Root-finding in One Dimension

- Bisection method
- Example 13.6 Solving $f(x)=0$
- Brent's method
- Example 13.6 Solving $f(x)=0$ with Brent's method: `uniroot`.

# 13.3 Numerical Integration

## 13.3 Numerical Integration

- Gaussian Quadrature Thm (classical stuff that works well for low-dim).
- Example 13.8 Numerical Integration with `integrate`
- R Note 13.4 is helpful. Named arguments to R function is safer and communicates better.
- Example 13.9 Density of sample correlation coefficient

# 13.4 Maximum Likelihood Problems

## 13.4 Maximum Likelihood Problems

- Notation and importance in statistics
- Example 13.10 MLE using `mle`

# 13.5 Application: Evaluating an Expected Value

## 13.5 Application: Evaluating an Expected Value

- Pareto type I distribution
- Example 13.11 Numerical integration
- Example 13.13 Direct evaluation
- Example 13.14 Plot of expected distance function

# Closing / Ch.13 Problem set
