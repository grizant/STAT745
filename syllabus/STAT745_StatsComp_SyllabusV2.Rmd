## WebCampus/Canvas

WebCampus/Canvas will be used for the majority of class business. Students are responsible for monitoring Announcements, Assignments/Due Dates, Course Files, and the Gradebook. The preferred mode of commuication for course-related discussion with the instructor is through Canvas messaging.

# Attendance

Students are expected to attend class.
If important circumstances prevent this, it is the student's responsibility to find out what was covered in class, what was assigned for reading or homework, and what special announcements (if any) were made.
"Excessive absence" in this class will be construed to be absence from more than 10 percent of the scheduled class sessions, whether excused or unexcused.

# Assignments

## Problem sets

Problem sets will be assigned each week, due on Fridays. You are encouraged to discuss assignments between each other and with instructor. However, the assignment must be completed and submitted individually. 

## Midterms
There will be one take-home midterm, due Friday, 26 Feb 2021. 

## Final exam
There will be a take-home final exam, due Friday, 7 May 2021. 

## Exam policy

Exams will be released roughly a week to before the due date. You must complete the exams without help. See Canvas for more details on take-home examination procedures.

## Makeup, Late Policy

* Problem sets solutions and completed exams are due on Fridays.
* Late assignments/exams will be given a 20% penalty per business day received late. (i.e., Saturday -0%, Sunday -0%, Monday -20% , Tuesday -40%, ..., Friday -100%).
* Exceptions will be made when a student misses work due to a documented (doctor's note) illness or an extraordinary situation (up to the discretion of the instructor). 
* There will be no early or make-up exams. 
* If you need to miss an exam due to participation in a religious holiday or an official university activities (including athletics and other sanctioned activities), you must make arrangements with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the exam in question. 

**I'll drop (trim) your 2 lowest grades in the "Problem Set" category to protect against 1-2 outlying points having too much weight (e.g., a 0).**

# Grading

We'll use a weighted categorical system to evaluate student learning. There are three categories of assignments. Table 1 shows the percentages for each category and the number of assignments (n). Table 2 displays the letter grade conversion for the total score from Table 1.

| Assignment | n  | %  |
|------------|----|----|
| Problem set  | 13 | 60 |
| Midterm    | 1  | 15 |
| Final Exam | 1  | 25 |
Table: Table 1. Grading scheme.

| Letter grade | % Range      |
|--------------|--------------|
| A            | 89.9 - up    |
| A-            | 87.9 - 89.8    |
| B+            | 84.9 - 87.8  |
| B            | 79.9 - 84.8  |
| B-            | 77.9 - 79.8  |
| C+            | 74.9 - 77.8  |
| C            | 69.9 - 74.8  |
| C-            | 67.9 - 69.8  |
| D            | 59.9 - 67.8  |
| F            | below - 59.8 |
Table: Table 2. Percentage range to letter grade conversion. 

*The instructor reserves the right to deviate from Table 2.*

## Statement on COVID-19 Training Policies

Students must complete and follow all guidelines as stated in the Student COVID-19 Training modules, or any other trainings or directives provided by the University.

## Statement on COVID-19 Face Coverings:

In response to COVID-19, and in alignment with State of Nevada Governor Executive Orders, Roadmap to Recovery for Nevada plans, Nevada System of Higher Education directives, the University of Nevada President directives, and local, state, and national health official guidelines face coverings are required at all times while on campus, except when alone in a private office. This includes the classroom, laboratory, studio, creative space, or any type of in-person instructional activity, and public spaces.

A “face covering” is defined as a “covering that fully covers a person’s nose and mouth, including without limitation, cloth face mask, surgical mask, towels, scarves, and bandanas” (State of Nevada Emergency Directive 024).

Students that cannot wear a face covering due to a medical condition or disability, or who are unable to remove a mask without assistance may seek an accommodation through the Disability Resource Center.

Face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing. Students shall observe current social distancing guidelines where possible in accordance with the Phase we are in while in the classroom, laboratory, studio, creative space (hereafter referred to as instructional space) setting and in public spaces. Students should avoid congregating around instructional space entrances before or after class sessions. If the instructional space has designated entrance and exit doors students are required to use them. Students should exit the instructional space immediately after the end of instruction to help ensure social distancing and allow for the persons attending the next scheduled class session to enter.

## Statement on COVID-19 Disinfecting Your Learning Space:

Disinfecting supplies are provided for you to disinfect your learning space. You may also use your own disinfecting supplies.

## Statement on COVID-19, COVID-19 Like Symptoms, and Contact with Someone Testing Positive for COVID-19:

Students must conduct daily health checks in accordance with CDC guidelines. Students testing positive for COVID 19, exhibiting COVID 19 symptoms or who have been in direct contact with someone testing positive for COVID 19 will not be allowed to attend in-person instructional activities and must leave the venue immediately. Students should contact the Student Health Center or their health care provider to receive care and who can provide the latest direction on quarantine and self-isolation. Contact your instructor immediately to make instructional and learning arrangements.

## Statement on Failure to Comply with Policy (including as outlined in this Syllabus) or Directives of a University Employee

In accordance with section 6,502 of the University Administrative Manual, a student may receive academic and disciplinary sanctions for failure to comply with policy, including this syllabus, for failure to comply with the directions of a University Official, for disruptive behavior in the classroom, or any other prohibited action. “Disruptive behavior" is defined in part as behavior, including but not limited to failure to follow course, laboratory or safety rules, or endangering the health of others. A student may be dropped from class at any time for misconduct or disruptive behavior in the classroom upon recommendation of the instructor and with approval of the college dean.
