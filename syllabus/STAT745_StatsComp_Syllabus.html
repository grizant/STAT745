<h2>WebCampus/Canvas</h2>
<p>WebCampus/Canvas will be used for the majority of class business. Students are responsible for monitoring Announcements, Assignments/Due Dates, Course Files, and the Gradebook. The preferred mode of commuication for course-related discussion with the instructor is through Canvas messaging.</p>

<h1>Attendance</h1>
<p>Students are expected to attend class. If important circumstances prevent this, it is the student’s responsibility to find out what was covered in class, what was assigned for reading or homework, and what special announcements (if any) were made. “Excessive absence” in this class will be construed to be absence from more than 10 percent of the scheduled class sessions, whether excused or unexcused.</p>

<h1>Assignments</h1>
<div id="problem-sets" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem sets</h2>
<p>Problem sets will be assigned each week, due on Fridays. You are encouraged to discuss assignments between each other and with instructor. However, the assignment must be completed and submitted individually.</p>
</div>
<div id="midterms" class="section level2">
<h2>Midterms</h2>
<p>There will be one take-home midterm, due Friday, 26 Feb 2021.</p>

<h2>Final exam</h2>
<p>There will be a take-home final exam, due Friday, 7 May 2021.</p>
</div>
<div id="exam-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Exam policy</h2>
<p>Exams will be released roughly a week to before the due date. You must complete the exams without help. See Canvas for more details on take-home examination procedures.</p>
</div>
<div id="makeup-late-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Makeup, Late Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Problem sets solutions and completed exams are due on Fridays.</li>
<li>Late assignments/exams will be given a 20% penalty per business day received late. (i.e., Saturday -0%, Sunday -0%, Monday -20% , Tuesday -40%, …, Friday -100%).</li>
<li>Exceptions will be made when a student misses work due to a documented (doctor’s note) illness or an extraordinary situation (up to the discretion of the instructor).</li>
<li>There will be no early or make-up exams.</li>
<li>If you need to miss an exam due to participation in a religious holiday or an official university activities (including athletics and other sanctioned activities), you must make arrangements with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the exam in question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I’ll drop (trim) your 2 lowest grades in the “Problem Set” category to protect against 1-2 outlying points having too much weight (e.g., a 0).</strong></p>

<div id="grading" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>We’ll use a weighted categorical system to evaluate student learning. There are three categories of assignments. Table 1 shows the percentages for each category and the number of assignments (n). Table 2 displays the letter grade conversion for the total score from Table 1.</p>
