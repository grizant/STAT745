<h1>Attendance</h1>
<p>Students are expected to attend class. If important circumstances prevent this, it is the student’s responsibility to find out what was covered in class, what was assigned for reading or homework, and what special announcements (if any) were made. “Excessive absence” in this class will be construed to be absence from more than 10 percent of the scheduled class sessions, whether excused or unexcused.</p>

<li>Exceptions will be made when a student misses work due to a documented (doctor’s note) illness or an extraordinary situation (up to the discretion of the instructor).</li>
<li>There will be no early or make-up exams.</li>
<li>If you need to miss an exam due to participation in a religious holiday or an official university activities (including athletics and other sanctioned activities), you must make arrangements with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the exam in question.</li>

<h2>Statement on COVID-19 Social Distancing:</h2>
<p>Face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing. Students shall observe current social distancing guidelines where possible in accordance with the Phase we are in while in the classroom, laboratory, studio, creative space (hereafter referred to as instructional space) setting and in public spaces. Students should avoid congregating around instructional space entrances before or after class sessions. If the instructional space has designated entrance and exit doors students are required to use them. Students should exit the instructional space immediately after the end of instruction to help ensure social distancing and allow for the persons attending the next scheduled class session to enter.</p>
